PRE_S’iM = trafficFlow -> isEmpty()

POST_S’iM = (state = heavyTraffic) implies ((signal = green) AND (greenTime > 60))
			XOR (state = lowTraffic) implies ((signal = red) AND (greenTime <= 60))
			XOR (state = highTraffic) implies (direction = CHOOSE)
			XOR (state = 0)implies (direction = NO_CHOOSE)
